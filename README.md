Crop Recommendation System to Maximize Crop Yield using Machine Learning Technique
Agriculture in every country plays a prominent role in its economy and employment. Canada is one of the largest agricultural
producers and exporters in the world. But it is noticed that there is a common problem faced amongst the farmers while farming,
that they don't choose the right crop based on their soil requirements and location. Due to this they face a serious setback in
productivity. This problem of the farmers has been addressed through precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is a modern 
farming technique that uses research data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data collection, and suggests the 
farmers the right crop based on their site-specific parameters. 

# Work:
Our website will help the farmers by recommending them an appropriate crop based on their soil type and location and assists them on making better decisions regarding farming. This increases the rate of accuracy in making the correct choice while selecting the crop and thus proliferate the productivity. A feature is also provided in the iOS Application for the farmers to find out the cause of a crop disease and to get its detailed description by just uploading the picture of the infected plant.
